\section{Exercise 2}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Formulate} the criterion that characterizes the existence of an extreme distribution (in terms of $\ol{F}$).
    \item \textbf{Determine and justify} by this criterion if the following distribution has an extreme distribution. The cumulative distribution function is given by
    \[  F(n) := 1-\frac{C}{{(n+1)}^{\ln (n+1)}} ,\hspace*{1em} n\in\N.\]
    \item In the case that it has a limit distribution, \textbf{argue} about which should be the limit distribution.
\end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Solution Part 2}

\[ \ol{F}(n) = \frac{C}{{(n+1)}^{\ln(n+1)}}. \]
