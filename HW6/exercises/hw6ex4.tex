\section{Exercise 4}

If $\pi_t$ is the random variable associated with the number of renovations that occur at a given time $t$. Then, its inverse function, takes as input the given number of renovations and returns the time they take. Since $\pi_t$ is the counting variable for exponential renovation times, then
\[ \mu_t = \sum_{i = 1}^{\pi_t} X_i, \]
where $X_i \sim \hbox{Exp}(\lambda)$, and thus, $\mu_t \sim \hbox{Gamma}(\pi_t, \lambda)$. This is a compound Poisson process.
